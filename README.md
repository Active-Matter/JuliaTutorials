# Julia Intro for Numerical Analysts

On this page I collect [Julia](http://julialang.org) example/tutorial
notebooks that I wrote to teach myself Julia. They are
intended primarily as a rapid introduction to Julia for
numerical analysts, mostly from the point of view of differential
equations. For more general introductions there are other sources
available, for example [Introducing Julia
(Wikibook)](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introducing_Julia) [Julia By
Example](http://www.scolvin.com/juliabyexample/) or [Learn X=Julia in
Y Minutes](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/julia/).

The examples are written as
[IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) notebooks. To edit
and run them you will need to install Julia and IJulia. First download
and install [Julia](http://julialang.org/downloads/), follow the
instructions on the [IJulia
Webpage](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl).

**Notes:**
1. At the moment these notebooks are not all are very polished. Please [let me
know](mailto:c.ortner@warwick.ac.uk) if you have problems running
them.
2. The codes in these tutorials are written primarily with simplicity in mind,
and don't use particularly advanced Julia concepts.
